# README #

This was originally a personal project for analysis of financial data. I is not finished yet, the most interesting part (analysis/prediction) is still missing. I'll try to come back to this if I can find time for it.
This readme file and also the code files were originally written in Spanish language. Code files are not translated.

## Repo objectives ##

* To build a dataset with mutual funds information from Santander Asset Management investments.

## Methodological notes ##

* Only one investment management company of interest is analysed.
* The data considers only the "universal" investment series, given the minimum investment amounts allowed.
* Data scraped from https://www.aafm.cl/tecnoera/index.php?clase=informe&metodo=rentabilidad_eei_html&administradora=96667040&dia=1&mes=1&anio=2010
